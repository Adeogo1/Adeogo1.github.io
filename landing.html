												<h3>LEAP.LEARN.LIVE!</h3>
											</header>
											<p>LEAP.LEARN.LIVE is a 2D endless platformer where you control a bouncing ball to move left and right, dodge obstacles, and avoid falling to your death. You can also collect coins which can be used to buy items in the store. This was created on unity using C#.
This games uses unity’s touch control and buttons to create the effect the when the player touches the left or right side they move in the corresponding direction. It also takes advantage of unity’s data perception to save the money and uses it to buy items that can be used in game

												<h3>Around The World</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Around The World is a 2D endless runner as well, where to begin you choose whether to go straight in or start a mini tutorial your difficulty which is decided by the map environment, Desert being easy, Jungle being medium and Arctic being hard and each of those maps have different obstacles some high and low but the player’s ability to double jump allows him to get past them well enough. There are also pickup that spawn randomly at different points in the game. The abilities are : Triple Jump – player gets an extra jump for the duration of the timer at the bottom and the colour of the UI depends on the map e.g. the arctic has blue UI, The next one is Increased Jump – This increases the player’s jump height by 50% which is quite a lot, the next one is shrink – this shrinks the player whole body size by 50% as well but everything else stays the same (excluding the collider) and the last one is invincibility – which allows the player to not get killed by any obstacle but they can still die if they fall in the water. The UI also changes based on the map using color theory I learned in order to have UI that looks nice together and doesn’t stick out like a sore thumb and I added some UI effects for example in the desert when you start you see a sandstorm blow towards you and when you die the UI also has a sandstorm, this is still the same thing with the Arctic but with snow instead that lands on the floor. This also the same with the river for each map.
The settings menu also consists of a volume slider which control the background volume in the game because the Desert has wind and water waves, the Jungle has jungle noises and water waves and the Artic has water waves.
The game also has gems which you can collect and use in the store to buy some skins unfortunately I couldn’t find any free assets to use

												<h3>Count</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This project was based on shooting a basketball in to a hoop and counting how many times the ball went in. This project required a good knowledge of maths and the kinematic equation as you couldn’t simply place a rigidbody on the object and expect it to work exactly. The project also uses that data to create a line predicting the trajectory of the ball as you can see in the image.</p>

												<h3>Unity Junior Programmer</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This project was a 2.5D endless runner where you dodge the incoming animals charging at you in the opposite direction to kill you/take a life and there are pickups that spawn randomly within the confines of the space that if the character collides with gives them an extra life. The character’s movements are also confined to the x and z axis as the game is a top-down endless runner.</p>

											</header>
											<p>This mini project is just a driving project where there are different obstacles based on difficulty and it uses driving mechanics such as suspension, drag, centre of mass. The project also measures the player’s speed in mph and displays it along side with the RPM. There is also a camera follow script where the camera follows the player with no jitter and also a local multiplayer mode with 2 split screen cars each with their own camera and moving obstacles.</p>

												<h3>Unity Junior Programmer 2</h3>
											</header>
											<p>So, this is another top down project where the player can only move on the x axis and shoot pizza projectiles at the animals running on the screen where there are 3 different types of animal and they each have different speed each time they spawn and they’re spawned using an invokerepeating method and a health bar created using UI canvas world space and if the health bar is completely green (hit 3 times) they die. The health bar is simply just a slider. The pizza projectile also uses object poling so the garbage collection isn’t called, optimizing the game even further.</p>

												<h3>Unity Junior Programmer 3</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This project uses animation to jump run and collide with the obstacles and it uses the animation transition states to switch between them depending on the action. There is also an obstacle and money spawner and when the gameobjects are spawned they move towards the player at a certain speed giving the effect that the player is moving but before all this starts there is an animation intro where the player walks to a position then the game starts and the music starts playing.
The player also has the ability to dash.

												<h3>Unity Junior Programmer 4</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This project utilises camera world rotation as movement so the player can move the ball on the z axis but if the want to move the all on the x axis they then have to move the camera around the platform. There were also pick up abilities where the player could collect gems that gave him abilities to have a stronger push force against the enemies, which spawn at random because there are different types of enemies and after each round they also increase in quantity until you reach the final round which the boss. There were also homing projectiles where if you press space projectile will come out depending on how many enemies are alive and it will follow them till they are hit.</p>

												<h3>Unity Junior Programmer 5</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This game is different as it contains a timer which is displayed on the UI in in the corner of the screen in seconds and when time is up the game is over and you score is set, your score is also based on the object you click on as skulls take away points and the other gameobjects add points to your score. It also come with a volume UI and a game over script allowing you to restart and change the difficulty. There is also interaction with the mouse and the game world as you click and swipe to interact with the objects.</p>
