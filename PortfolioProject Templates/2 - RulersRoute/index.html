								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This is a Fun, Fast-Paced, Arcade-Kart hybrid racing game with tons of surprises on the racetrack but that’s not where it stops because you also have the other racers too.
									You have ability boosters which make the race better for you as they improve and increase one of your stats randomly giving you the edge. But its not all good for everyone because there are also ability negators on the map which reduce one of your stats and that lead you had kiss it goodbye.</p>
								<p>The scariest thing on that race track are the racers or monsters if you prefer. They want to win as much as they want to stop you from winning … and they want to win a lot so watch your back. There are many different racers with different speeds, steering, weight and power. </p>
								<p>How do you enter the route of rulers and claim your trophy?</p>
								<p>You can choose to race alone or alone with a ghost or with the other racers. Then you choose the racer you want to be and the routes you want to race in and in what order. After each race you rewarded points on your position so make sure to win. And after all the races the points are tallied up to reveal who truly is the RULER of the ROUTE.</p>

								<p>Car controller </p>
								<p>Ackerman Steering - I did ackerman steering which is an important feature in creating car controllers. With ackerman steering the reason it exists is so your tires don’t slip when you go around a corner and how you achieve this is by having a central point at which your tires are rotating around the angle of tire number 3 is going to be greater than tire number 1, so with that angle being greater they can come to a central point and all 4 tires can rotate around that point, which means the tires don’t have to slip as they go around.So to Summarize -  The Ackerman steering is used in car-like vehicles. The basic idea consists of rotating the inner wheel slightly sharper than the outer wheel to reduce tire slippage.</p>
								<p>StickForce/Downforce - As you drive the car loses traction(the grip of the tire on the road) and adding a downforce makes it stick better to the ground. The way we add downforce is by using the rigidbody add force. This is because without the downforce the car will sort of drift in a very unstable and difficult to control way. Basically, when researching downforce the explanation i found that was simple to understand was like this. So when you're thinking about the wings of an aero plane as the plane is moving the velocity/speed of air passing over the wing increases, a high pressure pocket is created underneath the wing and low pressure pockets are created above and eventhough i don't have a diagram to display this you can imagine that it would cause some sort of rising which in this case is a force called lift (created by the pressure differential). However, Downforce is the opposite, it applies pressure downwards, keeping the car towards the ground.</p>
								<p>Center of mass - This is also an important feature for car controllers and getting them to do things properly because as the unreal documentation says Weight distribution of a vehicle is important to its control because it affects a variety of its characteristics, like handling, acceleration, traction and even whether or not the car flips over. It's also really important depending on what type of game you're making e.g. a simulation or arcade game.  The Center of Mass is usually at the center of this Physics Body, which can make the vehicle handle oddly, so you can adjust the Center of Mass to account for where the mass of the vehicle is really located and i did this manually by creating an empty GO and placing it on the car and setting the C.o.M. to be at that position but you can also handle it automatically through calculation which i may implement. I also made the CoM low to the ground and since it's low to the ground and can get to high speed quickly, the lower rear Center of Mass helps to stabilize the car, especially with jumps.</p>
								<p>Suspension - The job of a car suspension is to maximise the friction between the tires and road surface during acceleration, cruising and braking and also provide steering stability with good handling and ensure the comfort of the passenger. Basically newtons law states forces have both magnitude and direction and a bump in the road causes the wheel to move up and down, perpendicular to the road surface direction. The magnitude depends on whether the wheel is on a tiny speck or giant bump. The wheel experiences a vertical acceleration as it passes over an imperfection and that means the wheel goes up. Without an intervening structure, the vehicles vertical energy is transferred to the car’s frame which moves up, the wheel loses contact with the road and slam back down unto the road. So you need a system that absorbs the energy of the vertically accelerated wheel allowing the frame and body to ride undisturbed while the wheels follow bumps in the road. Which is vehicle dynamics (the study of forces at work on a moving car ). The suspension system has to handle dive (when the nose of the car tilts forward/down when braking) and squat (the opposite of dive due to acceleration) cars usually have a different type of suspension in the front and back and you can either have a dependent system (where a rigid axle bind the wheels) or independent (where the wheels are permitted to move independently).
								</p>
								<p>Camber - camber is the angle so it would make more sense to say camber angle but it is the angle between the vertical axis of a wheel and the vertical axis of a vehicle. Put another way, it’s whether or not your tires lean towards or away from the car when viewed from the front of the vehicle. If the top of the tire leans towards the vehicle, the car is said to have “negative camber.” On the other hand, if the top of the tire is tilted away from the car, it has “positive camber.” If it’s perfectly straight, then you have “zero camber.” The camber angle has a tremendous impact on your car’s performance, affecting everything from wear and tear on the tires to how well the vehicle handles. This is important because when you're turning a corner a car with negative camber would be the best and it would be an important factor in races because a car with zero camber will roll towards its outer edge when taking a corner because of centrifugal force and possibly cause the car to slide.</p>
								<p>AntiRoll bar -  it takes in the rigidbody and the anti roll bar uses car suspension. When one side of the car goes down the other one goes up and the anti roll bar does the opposite of that and to simulate it we need to manipulate the springs.
									During cornering, the sprung mass of the body will naturally be shifted towards the outer side of the car, otherwise known as body roll. This isn’t something you want - as the car leans the wheels start to tilt, reducing the contact patch of the tyres. Excessive roll also results in a car that isn’t as responsive, as it’ll take longer to react, which is not good in a racing game but between the downforce and the centre of gravity the anti roll bar doesn't do too much and its effect is barely visible but this may be due to the inaccurate proportions of the cars e.g the motor force+ weight etc.
									The main effect of an anti-roll bar from within the car is what the name suggests; it reduces the amount that the body of the car can roll.</p>
									<p>There are many more technical features that were included in the game and more detailed explanation for the ones above.</p>
